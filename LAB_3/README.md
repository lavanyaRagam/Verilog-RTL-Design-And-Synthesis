## Combinational Logic Optimization

###Squeezing the Logic to Get the Most Optimized Design

**Definition:**  
Optimize a digital design by removing redundant gates, merging logic, and simplifying paths.

**Key Techniques:**  
- Constant propagation  
- Boolean simplification  
- Removing unused signals

**Benefits:**  
- Reduced area and power  
- Improved speed  
- Cleaner, easier-to-verify netlist

**Example:**  
```text
Original: y = (a AND b) OR (a AND b AND c)
Optimized: y = a AND b
```
### Constant Propagation

**Definition:**  
Constant propagation is a combinational logic optimization technique where constant values in a design are identified and propagated through the logic network.

**How it Works:**  
- If a signal is tied to a constant (`0` or `1`), the synthesizer replaces all instances of that signal with the constant value.  
- Logic expressions involving constants are automatically simplified.

**Example:**  
```text
y = a AND 1  ‚Üí  y = a
y = a AND 0  ‚Üí  y = 0
```
### Boolean Logic Optimization

**Definition:**  
Boolean logic optimization is the process of simplifying Boolean expressions to reduce the number of gates, logic levels, and overall complexity.

**How it Works:**  
- Apply algebraic simplifications such as De Morgan‚Äôs laws, distributive, associative, and commutative properties.  
- Synthesis tools automatically minimize logic to remove redundancy.

**Example:**  
```text
Original: y = (a AND b) OR (a AND b AND c)
Simplified: y = a AND b
```
## Sequential Logic Optimization

### Sequential Constant Propagation

**Definition:**  
Sequential constant propagation is an optimization technique applied to sequential circuits (flip-flops, latches, and registers) where constant values are propagated through sequential elements to simplify logic and states.

**How it Works:**  
- Identify signals or states that always assume constant values under certain conditions.  
- Propagate these constants through flip-flops and combinational logic.  
- Simplify logic or remove unnecessary transitions that do not affect circuit behavior.

**Example:**  
```text
A flip-flop Q is always reset under certain input conditions.
Logic dependent on Q can be simplified using Q = 0, reducing gates and paths.
```

### State Optimization

**Definition:**  
State optimization is a technique used in sequential circuits (like finite state machines, FSMs) to reduce the number of states without changing the circuit‚Äôs functional behavior.

**How it Works:**  
- Identify equivalent or redundant states in the state machine.  
- Merge these states into a single representative state.  
- Update the state transition table and logic to reflect the merged states.

**Example:**  
```text
An FSM has states S1 and S2 that behave identically for all inputs.
Merge S1 and S2 into a single state, reducing the total number of states and required flip-flops.
```
### Retiming

**Definition:**  
Retiming is a sequential circuit optimization technique where flip-flops are repositioned across combinational logic to improve performance while preserving the circuit‚Äôs functional behavior.

**How it Works:**  
- Move flip-flops forward or backward across logic gates without changing input-output behavior.  
- Adjust timing paths to balance delays, reduce critical path length, and meet timing constraints.  
- Often used with synthesis tools that automatically determine optimal register placement.

**Example:**  
```text
A critical path with high combinational delay can be split by moving a flip-flop to shorten the path, improving the maximum operating frequency.
```
### Sequential Logic Cloning

**Definition:**  
Sequential logic cloning is an optimization technique where copies of certain sequential elements (like flip-flops or registers) are created to balance load, reduce fan-out, or shorten critical paths in a circuit.

**How it Works:**  
- Identify flip-flops or registers driving multiple downstream logic blocks (high fan-out).  
- Create clones of the sequential element to drive subsets of the logic independently.  
- This reduces the load on any single flip-flop, improving timing and reliability.

**Example:**  
```text
A flip-flop Q drives 10 logic blocks, causing a long delay.
By cloning Q, two flip-flops each drive 5 blocks, reducing delay and improving performance.
```
## Unused Output Optimization

**Definition:**  
Unused output optimization removes or simplifies logic associated with outputs that are never used, reducing unnecessary gates and logic levels.

**How it Works:**  
- Identify outputs that are never read or connected externally.  
- Remove or mark the logic driving these outputs as "don't care" to allow synthesis optimization.  
- Simplify intermediate logic that only affects unused outputs.

**Example:**  
```text
A module generates outputs y1, y2, y3, but only y1 is used.
Logic for y2 and y3 can be removed by the synthesizer.
```
## Labs on optimization

Output y follows b when control signal a is 1.

Output y is 0 when control signal a is 0.

Follow the steps from [Day 1 Synthesis flow](#day-1-synthesis-flow) and insert the following step **between `abc -liberty` and `synth -top`** commands.

```bash
opt_clean -purge
```
