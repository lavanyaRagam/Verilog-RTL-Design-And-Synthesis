Verilog-RTL-Design-And-Synthesis
In this program, I gained hands-on experience with Verilog RTL design, learning how to simulate and run Verilog code using Icarus Verilog (iverilog) and GTKWave. For synthesis, I utilized Yosys to generate and analyze the synthesized netlist.

About this program
This program targets students and engineers who want to gain knowledge in:
Designing and simulating Verilog RTL circuits
Performing simulation and waveform analysis using Icarus Verilog and GTKWave
Conducting logic synthesis with Yosys and the SKY130 open-source PDK
Understanding essential digital design concepts, such as testbenches, timing libraries, D flip-flop coding styles, and optimization methods
Prerequisites
Fundamental knowledge of digital logic, including gates, flip-flops, and multiplexers
Basic proficiency with Linux shell commands
Access to a Linux environment (or WSL on Windows/macOS)
Required tools: git, iverilog, gtkwave, yosys, and a text editor
Program Structure
The program is structured day-wise, with each day having its own folder and corresponding README.
⦁	Day 1: Introduction to Verilog RTL Design and Synthesis
⦁	Day 2: Standard Cell Library, Logic Synthesis and Flip-Flop Design
⦁	Day 3: Combinational and Sequential Logic Optimization
⦁	Day 4: Gate-Level Simulation (GLS), Blocking vs. Non-Blocking in Verilog, and Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch
⦁	Day 5: Optimization in Synthesis

Each day’s README contains:
Detailed explanations of the concepts covered that day
Stepwise practical labs complete with code examples and screenshots
Helpful tips and recommended practices for RTL design
